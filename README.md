# Creation and set up of REST API's using Django and Docker

[here](#Assumptions)

## Assumptions
1) While validating the 'values' list, only the 'value' is validated as per the condition given in problem statement, the 'entity_type' will be always valid and need not be checked. 
```
  "values": [
    {
      "entity_type": "id",
      "value": "college"
    }
  ]
  "values": [
    {
      "entity_type": "number",
      "value": 23
    }
  ]
```
